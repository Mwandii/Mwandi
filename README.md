## 🌟 About Me

I started with software engineering because I believe that technology is one of the most powerful tools for solving real-world problems. 

I’m still figuring out exactly what drives me most, but I’m drawn to:

- ✨ Building beautiful, functional web experiences
- 🧠 Learning how the internet works under the hood
- 🤝 Collaborating with others to solve real problems

## 🎯 My Vision

My aim is to **use the skills I learn to impact the rugby world in Kenya**, both on and off the field. I want to bridge the gap between sports and tech by building platforms that serve rugby fans, athletes, coaches, and communities.

That’s why I’m focusing on:

- 🧱 Learning how to build different types of websites
- 📊 Understanding front-end design systems and data visualization
- ⚙️ Gaining real-world project experience to solve local challenges
